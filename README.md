## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is the UCI Spambase dataset, which contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. The dataset includes features derived from the email text, allowing for effective classification.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
Usage
Load the Dataset: Use the provided dataset file to load and preprocess the data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data and transform it using TfidfVectorizer.
Train the Model: Train the logistic regression model and/or Naive Bayes classifier.
Evaluate the Model: Use cross-validation and performance metrics (precision, recall, f1-score) to evaluate model performance.
Predict New Emails: The trained model can be used to classify new email inputs.
Model Evaluation
The model achieved the following average accuracies during cross-validation:

Logistic Regression: 97.94%
Naive Bayes: 98.36%
